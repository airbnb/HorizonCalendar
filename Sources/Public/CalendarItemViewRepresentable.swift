// MARK: - CalendarItemViewRepresentable

/// A protocol to which types that can create and update views displayed in `CalendarView` must conform. By conforming to this
/// protocol, `CalendarView` is able to treat each view it displays as a function of its `invariantViewProperties` and its
/// `viewModel`, simplifying the initialization and state updating of views.

  /// A type containing all of the immutable / initial setup values necessary to initialize the view. Use this to configure appearance
  /// options that do not change based on the data in the `viewModel`.
  associatedtype InvariantViewProperties: Hashable

  /// A type containing all of the variable data necessary to update the view. Use this to update the dynamic, data-driven parts of the
  /// view.
  associatedtype ViewModel: Equatable

  /// Creates a view using a set of invariant view properties that contain all of the immutable / initial setup values necessary to
  /// configure the view. All immutable / view-model-independent properties should be configured here. For example, you might set up
  /// a `UILabel`'s `textAlignment`, `textColor`, and `font`, assuming none of those properties change in response to
  /// `viewModel` updates.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - invariantViewProperties: An instance containing all of the immutable / initial setup values necessary to initialize the
  ///   view. Use this to configure appearance options that do not change based on the data in the `viewModel`.
