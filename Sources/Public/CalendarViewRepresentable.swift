// MARK: - CalendarViewRepresentable

/// A declarative, performant calendar `View` that supports use cases ranging from simple date pickers all the way up to
/// fully-featured calendar apps. Its declarative API makes updating the calendar straightforward, while also providing many
/// customization points to support a diverse set of designs and use cases.
///
/// `CalendarView` does not handle any business logic related to day range selection or deselection. Instead, it provides a
/// single callback for day selection, allowing you to customize selection behavior in any way that you’d like.
///
/// Your business logic can respond to the day selection callback: update any backing-models for your feature. If those backing models
/// are inputs to your view (for example, `@State`), then the calendar will re-render with the latest data.
///
/// - Note: This `View` wraps a UIKit `CalendarView`, enabling it to be used in a SwiftUI hierarchy.

  ///   - calendar: The calendar on which all date operations will be performed. Defaults to `Calendar.current` (the system's
  ///   current calendar).
  ///   - visibleDateRange: The date range that will be displayed. The dates in this range are interpreted using the provided
  ///   `calendar`.
  ///   - monthsLayout: The layout of months - either vertically or horizontally.
  ///   - dataDependency: Any data or state that, when updated, should cause the calendar to re-render. This is needed because
  ///   `CalendarView` lazily invokes item provider closures outside of the normal SwiftUI update loop. To ensure that the calendar
  ///   is updated at the right times, pass in any properties that are accessed in your item provider closures. For example, if a
  ///   `dayItemProvider` closure accesses a local state variable called `selectedDay`, then pass it in here.
